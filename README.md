### Predictive Analysis of the 2023/2024 Serie A Season Using Poisson Distribution

## Introduction
This project utilizes the Poisson distribution to predict the outcomes of matches in the 2023/2024 Serie A season. By leveraging historical data from goal.com, this analysis provides a statistical foundation for forecasting match results, offering valuable insights for teams, analysts, and bettors.

## Aim
The aim of this project is to apply the Poisson distribution to predict match outcomes in the Serie A season, using historical data to inform the model and validate its predictions.

## Data Collection
The dataset was sourced from goal.com and includes match statistics, results, and team performance metrics for the 2023/2024 Serie A season.

## Steps Taken

### 1. Data Cleaning and Preparation
- Imported the dataset into Excel.
- Performed initial data cleaning to ensure accuracy and consistency.
- Removed anomalies and incomplete entries.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Conducted a comprehensive EDA to understand data distribution and trends.
- Visualized key metrics such as goals scored, goals conceded, and match outcomes for each team.

### 3. Poisson Distribution Application
- Calculated the average number of goals scored and conceded by each team.
- Applied the Poisson distribution to predict the number of goals likely to be scored in future matches.
- Refined the Poisson model using historical match data.

### 4. Model Validation
- Compared predicted outcomes with actual match results to assess model accuracy.
- Adjusted model parameters based on observed discrepancies to improve predictive reliability.

## Poisson Distribution Explained
The Poisson distribution is used to predict the probability of a given number of goals being scored in a match. The formula for the Poisson probability mass function is:

\[ P(X = x) = \frac{e^{-\lambda} \lambda^x}{x!} \]

Where:
- \( \lambda \) is the average rate (mean number of goals scored in this context).
- \( x \) is the actual number of goals scored.
- \( e \) is the base of the natural logarithm.

By calculating \( \lambda \) for both home and away teams, scorelines for upcoming matches can be predicted.

## Example: Frosinone vs. Inter
Using the Poisson distribution, the model predicted:
- **Expected Goals:** 0.52 for Frosinone and 3.23 for Inter.
- **Probabilities:** 3.19% chance for a Frosinone win, 88.46% chance for an Inter win, and 8.35% chance for a draw.
- **Betting Scores:** These probabilities were converted into betting scores, indicating the relative likelihood of each outcome.

## Conclusion
The Poisson distribution proved to be a valuable tool for predicting match outcomes in the Serie A. While not infallible, the model provided a statistically sound method for forecasting match results based on historical performance.

## Recommendations
1. **Further Data Integration**: Incorporating additional variables such as player injuries, weather conditions, and in-game events could enhance the modelâ€™s accuracy.
2. **Real-Time Updates**: Implementing a dynamic system that updates predictions based on real-time data could provide more relevant and timely insights.
3. **Application to Other Leagues**: This methodology can be adapted for use in other football leagues, providing a broader application for predictive sports analytics.
